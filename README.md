# React Practice Project: RoboFriends

This is a project I made while going through the Udemy course "Complete React Native in 2023." It uses React and Tachiyons for simple styling. My goal with this project was to refresh my skills using React while also learning the updated tools for 2023 such as hooks.

## Specific Skills:

- Custom component building
- Standard naming and organization conventions
- Styling using CSS and Tachiyons
- State management without Redux
- Proper data flow from parent to child
- Fetching third party API's to use in project
- ComponentDidMount hook
